Ginkgo Research License: free distribution license agreement exclusively for non-commercial research 

Preamble 
This agreement is a royalty free software license whose purpose is to grant users the freedom to use, modify and redistribute the software licensed hereunder for research purpose excluding any commercial use.
The exercise of these freedoms is subject to certain obligations on users in order to preserve this status during subsequent redistributions. The accessibility of the source code and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute it have the counterpart of offering users only a limited guarantee and imposing only a limited liability on the author of the software, the holder of the economic rights and the successive licensors.
In consideration of access to the software and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's attention, given its near open source status, which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.
This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
